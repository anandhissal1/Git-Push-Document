Scaling: able to modify resources count
-> Horizontal Scaling : Create multiple EC2 Instances.
-> Vertical Scaling: Increase System capacity (CPU, RAM, Storage).

LoadBalacing:
-> Used for Horizontal Scaling.
-> Distribute Load(Request) equal to all machines.

AutoScaling:
-> Create/Reduce Multiple EC2 Instances based on metrics(CPU usage)
-> Launch Templates : Contains details to create EC2 Instance
(selected details : instance type, AMI, VPC, KP, EBS, UserData ..etc)

================================================================
	Session-2
=> EBS: Elastic Block Store
=> Comes under storage (SSD/HDD)
=> Block Level Storage
=> Primary Volume (root volume)
   Secondary Volume (additional volume)
=> Attached, Detacted to an EC2 Instance.
=> Finally need to be mounted/un-mounted to a path
=> EBS Volume (Sec one) min size : 1 GiB, max size: 16384 GiB
=> Both EC2 and Root EBS volumes are created in same zone.
ex: Ec2 -> ap-south-1a, ebs vol : ap-south-1a
=> EBS volumes are Availability Zone specific.

Q) What is Delete on termination of EBS Volume incase of EC2 Instance?
A) If we keep Delete on termination - YES, it means if we terminate EC2
   Instance then Its root volume also deleted.
   If we select NO(Delete on termination), EBS volume still exist
   even After EC2 Instance termination.
