AWS EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud

(Amazon Machine Image)
AMI: It indicates OS and some pre-configured applications
	like Java, Python, .Net Runtime etc.


Instance type: It indicates CPU and RAM details for our EC2.

VPC: Virtual Private Cloud
-> Netwroking (Private Network Configuration)
-> Subnetwork (Subnet in a AZ)
-> Security Configuration (SG)

Volumes: EBS Elastic Block Stores
-> To install OS, store your data, install apps
   we need storage.

-> Every EC2 Instance contains unique id (instance-id)
   and a state (Running, Stopped..etc)
-> EC2 Instance gets one Private IP and Public IP (if configured).
