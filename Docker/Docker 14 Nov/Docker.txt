---------------------
containerization : Packing Application into Image(Code + Dep + Runtime)
	that can become independent of OS to run application.
	If we run image, then container is created.

Orchestration: Manage Multiple containers.
  Create, Update, Scale(Up/Down), remove, moniter ..etc

*) Above works can be done by DevOps engineer (manually) or we can inform
  to Docker Swarm  (or any Orchestration tool for automation)

*) downtime : Stopping Service for a period of time.
*) self heal: makesure no.of instances running, if any instance/container
	is down/removed, then new container is created (in any one Machine)

*) Convert any one machine as master
sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.31.38.233

*) services : Creating containers with given replicas(count)

sudo docker service create --name my-web-app -p 8080:8080 javabyraghu/maven-web-app
