--------------------
SonarQube is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource 
for continuous inspection of code quality

Q) how do they measure code quality?
A) By setting some rules

=> SonarQube is developed using Java. 
   So, Java S/w is required to install and run

Q) What is mean by "systectl enable <service-name>" ?
A) When we stop OS(Linux Machine) service will be stopped.
   If we start OS, service will not be started by default.
   We need to start again "systemctl start".

   systemctl enable => Makes App startup on OS loading(starting of OS).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
=> Set of rules given by SonarQube.

*) Rule    : A condition that validates code.
*) Profile : selected rules, which are going to be applied for a project.
